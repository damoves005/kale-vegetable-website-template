            obligation or based on the Users' consent.</p>

        <h2>The purposes of processing</h2>
        <p>The Data concerning the User is collected to allow the Owner to provide its Service, comply with its legal
            obligations, respond to enforcement requests, protect its rights and interests (or those of its Users or
            third parties), detect any malicious or fraudulent activity, as well as the following: Analytics and
            Displaying content from external platforms.</p>

        <p>For specific information about the Personal Data used for each purpose, the User may refer to the section
            "Detailed information on the processing of Personal Data".</p>

        <h2>Detailed information on the processing of Personal Data</h2>

        </ul>
        <p>This Application uses Trackers. To learn more, Users may consult the Cookie Policy.</p>

        <h2>Further Information for Users</h2>
        <h3>Legal basis of processing</h3>
        <p>The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes.</li>
            <li>provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any
                pre-contractual obligations thereof;</li>
            <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;</li>
            <li>processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
                official authority vested in the Owner;</li>
            <li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third
                party.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing,
            and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a
            requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p>

        <h3>Further information about retention time</h3>
        <p>Unless specified otherwise in this document, Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as
            required by the purpose they have been collected for and may be retained for longer due to applicable legal
            obligation or based on the Users' consent.</p>

        <p>Therefore:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between the Owner and the
                User shall be retained until such contract has been fully performed.</li>
            <li>Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner's legitimate interests shall be retained as long
                as needed to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the legitimate
                interests pursued by the Owner within the relevant sections of this document or by contacting the Owner.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given consent to
            such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain
            Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to fulfil a legal obligation or upon order of an
            authority.</p>

        <p>Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right of access, the right
            to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after expiration
            of the retention period.</p>

        <h2>The rights of Users based on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h2>
        <p>Users may exercise certain rights regarding their Data processed by the Owner.</p>
